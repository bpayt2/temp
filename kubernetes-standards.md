# Summary

Kubernetes first entered Ulta Beauty in 2020 charged to deliver a flexible non-prescriptive application hosting platform that allows for rapid innovation, while at the same time providing consistent, common patterns for security, networking, and physical/virtual resources across cloud providers, unencumbered by legacy processes. Since then, Kubernetes has been solidified as Ulta Beauty's internal application platform of choice. The Kubernetes ecosystem is the collection of products and services that are built to best propel and empower Ulta Beautyâ€™s present and future technology focus and optimization.

The standards set forth within this document serve to ensure the strategic alignment, optimal use and performance, availability and reliability, and overall Ulta Beauty success.

Standards are accessed against solutions to determine *well-architected* and production readiness.

## Standards

### Availability

#### Standard #1

Minimum replicas per deployment is 2

##### Standard

Deployment configurations should define replicas as equal to 2, not 1.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```txt
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: example-deployment
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
    **replicas: 2**
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: example
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: example
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: example-container
            image: ex-image:1.0.0
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
  ```
</details>

##### Rationale

- Two replicas provides high availability for service load balancing
- Two replicas are used to position a workload across two fault domains (e.g. Google Cloud Platform zones or VMware hosts)
- More than two replicas should be initiated by scaling
- Removes single point of failure
- Creates smaller workload, thus faster scheduling and startup; load spread across two pods requires less upfront requests

##### Implications

- Requires accurate pod sizing to avoid cost increase

##### Caveats

- Stateful sets are not associated to this standard as default is generally 3

#### Standard #2

Topology spread constraints are applied to each deployment

##### Standard

Topology spread constraints should be used to ensure pod replicas are distributed evenly across fault domains.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```txt
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: example-deployment
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      # Configure a topology spread constraint
      topologySpreadConstraints:
        - maxSkew: <integer>
          minDomains: <integer> # optional; beta since v1.25
        **topologyKey: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone**
        **whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule**
        **labelSelector: app = example**
          matchLabelKeys: <list> # optional; beta since v1.27
          nodeAffinityPolicy: [Honor|Ignore] # optional; beta since v1.26
          nodeTaintsPolicy: [Honor|Ignore] # optional; beta since v1.26
      ### other Pod fields go here
  ```
</details>

##### Rationale

- Clusters are provisioned to position nodes across fault domains (e.g. VMware hosts and GCP zones), but applications do not inherently benefit from this.
- Ensures scaling of replicas are distributed evenly across a desired number of fault domains
- Is more sophisticated then managing through a combination of affinities and anti-affinities (legacy approach)

##### Implications

- Affinities and anti-affinities need to be considered with topology spread constraints when applications need to collocated 'dependencies' on nodes

##### Caveats

- None
